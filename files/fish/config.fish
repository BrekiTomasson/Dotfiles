#    Configuration File by Breki Tomasson
#
# =============================================================================
# = This file contains the various configurations for the Fish shell, broken  =
# = down into sections to optimise legibility and oversight. To as great a    =
# = degree as possible, anything not required in this file has been moved to  =
# = elsewhere. For example, this file contains no alias definitions, as all   =
# = aliases have been redefined as functions instead.                         =
# =============================================================================


# === Add a couple of paths to Fish User Paths ================================

set -g fish_user_paths "/usr/local/sbin" $fish_user_paths
set -g fish_user_paths "/Users/brekitomasson/Projects/Dotfiles/scripts" $fish_user_paths
